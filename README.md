# Eule.py

A Diablo III Macro Collection.\
The Macros work on all Resolutions.\
Supported _Auto Stuff_ Resolutions can be found on the bottom.

## Macros

All Macros are sent directly to Diablo III without using your physical mouse or keyboard.\
This has numerous advantages, such as

* Faster Macro execution time
* Reliability
* Working without Diablo III beeing in the foreground

## Setting Hotkeys

To set a Hotkey

1. Click the Button next to the Label of the Hotkey you would like to set
2. Press the combination of keys you would like to use
3. Accept the new Combination

You may cancel setting a Hotkey by pressing __Escape__.\
You may delete a Hotkey by clicking and pressing __Delete__.

## Abbrevations

* Replaces Abbrevations with full sentences.
* To use an added Abbrevation, type it in the chat and then tap __space__ once.

I prefer this Version of sending Messages over a simple Hotkey Version due to having to remember less Hotkeys.

## Third Party Launcher

* Launches your Third Party Tools.
* Upon first Startup select the paths to your Tools.
* You will have to reconfigure pHelper at first use.
* Start Eule.py as Admin to not have to accept the Popups.

## Auto Stuff

* Automates some of the Macros using Image Recognition.
* Requires Diablo to be in Windowed (Fullscreen) Mode.
* Works with TurboHUD.
* Bigger Size => Longer Startup (depending on your Hardware).
* Check at the Bottom if it is working for your Resolution.

The Size of the this Version sadly is more or less staying the way it is.\
This is the case due to Python Image Librarys beeing extremely large when compiled.
